        <p>Narrow down your philantropic priorities to realistically fit your resources and donation goals.  
          Understand how your donations can best contribute to the causes that are important to you.  A national 
          organization may be better suited for conducting research, while a local group can serve your community.  
          Through GivHub, it is possible to discover charities by category.</p>
        <p>Once you have found a charity, research the organization before committing your support.  Ensure that the 
          charity is a tax exempt public charity [US Internal Revenue Code section 501(c)(2)].  You can request the 
          organization's EIN in order to confirm its status with the IRS.  Review the charity's finances to assess its 
          efficiency in accomplishing their mission.  The GivHub team is working to create features that will allow 
          users to better assess financial history and records.</p>
        <p>Check an organization's mission statement.  What have been their significant accomplishments?  What are their 
          current goals, and what, if any, challenges are they facing?  When you trust a charity, you can comfortably 
          contribute unrestricted donations; allowing the charity discretion to determine how best to provide its services.  
          Charities are dependent on long-term support, so follow up on your investments and ensure that your goals are 
          being satisfied by the organization.</p>
